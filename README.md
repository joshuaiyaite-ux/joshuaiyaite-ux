##👋 Hey, I’m Joshua Gabriel  
I’m an IT student and video editor with a growing passion for *programming* and *cybersecurity*. Currently sharpening my skills in tech while blending creativity through video edits.

💻 Learning how to code, hack (ethically 😉), and solve real-world problems.  
🎬 I tell stories through visuals—editing is my escape.  
🌱 Always curious, always exploring.  
📍 Based in Kenya, building my future one line of code at a time.

Let’s connect, create, and grow 🚀
